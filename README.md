# Paper.io 2 configurator

One day I was playing Paper.io 2 and suddenly my internet connection dropped.
Somehow (if someone thought that this game was hosted on a server) I was able
to continue playing offline. After some research I found out that the the game
engine actually runs locally in the browser and you even can change some
parameters of the game dynamically. Changing parameters was fun, but doing it
from the browser console was tedious. So I created this small chrome extension
to make it easier to change parameters :3
